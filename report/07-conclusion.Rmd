# Conclusion
From our analysis, we discovered that although CO2 emissions were increasing in the World, CO2 emission ratios were decreasing. The decrease in CO2 emission ratios throughtout the world were due to the global trend of renewable energy ratio increasing. Countries with high renewable energy ratio had relatively higher GDP per Capita rather than Total GDP, which hints that the commitment of individuals in each country is important for increasing renewable energy ratios. 

We hope that our analysis and our interactive visualization improved your understanding of the current global situation of renewable energy. Let's continue fighting for a greener planet and a renewable future.
