Today, more people than ever are backing and contributing to the movement for a greener planet, and a huge factor for this movement’s growth is the increase in awareness for climate change. Even compared to a few years ago, there are more news articles available to help start conversations about climate change. As more media outlets begin talking about the green movement, more and more people are becoming educated and motivated to help make a change. Interestingly, a lot of the existing data and science about climate change have always been around. However, these findings were not always easily accessible to the general population without the help of media. Producing scientific research is not enough to get people talking about climate change; people have to be emotionally moved. Our team was inspired by Bloomberg Businessweek’s visualization: “What’s Really Warming the World?”. From a technical standpoint, the visualization is just a basic line plot on very standard data. However, the way that the underlying message is framed and presented produces a very impactful and accessible visualization. The animation and supporting text help display a very logical progression of thoughts to viewers, delivering a message to viewers at a more emotional level. This visualization motivated our team to take advantage of the vast available data on climate change to produce a tool that presents our findings from a human-centered standpoint in hopes of inspiring others to join the push for a greener world. Our team chose to focus on renewable energy. In this study, we examined the usage of renewable energy sources at the country level over time and studied relationships between renewables usage, emissions, and financial states. Through our findings and visualizations, we hope to generate an optimistic sentiment by presenting the positive effects of switching to renewables and encourage people to continue fighting towards a renewable future.

["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our study involves combining and processing several datasets from different sources listed below: BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy: Contains energy data at the country level split by energy sources (oil, gas, coal, nuclear, solar, wind, biofuels, etc) and CO2 emissions data from 1965 to 2018. Thematic Mapping World Borders Dataset\" Provides shape file polygon data for country borders used for plotting as well as country metadata such as ISO codes, land area, population, etc. UN Region Codelist: Provides mapping for region codes to region names International Monetary Fund: Provides a range of time series data for economic and financial indicators. The World Bank’s Data Bank: Provides a collection of time series data for various topics around the world, such as World Development Indicators, Statistical Capacity Indicators, Educational Statistics, Gender Statistics, etc. Global Finance’s Global Data: Provides economic data for finance and economics, and non-economic data for politics and social measures. Statista: Provides all kinds of business data, such as social media, e-commerce, gaming, film industry, etc. Sustainable Development Goals: Provides SDG related data sources to aid for evidence-based decision-making and advocacy. NAICS Association: Provides data regarding different businesses around the world. Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook: Provides information on the history, people and society, government, economy, energy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues for 267 world entities.

["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Emissions and Renewables", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Emissions and Renewables Overall, CO2 emissions have been steadily increasing across the globe. df %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% summarise(total_co2 = sum(co2)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=total_co2)) + geom_line(color=&quot;tan4&quot;, size=1) + ggtitle(&quot;Total CO2 Emissions 1965-2018&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;CO2 Emissions (millions of tonnes)&quot;) Focusing on a specific country, we can see that the United States’ CO2 emissions have also been increasing, with slight occasional drops. ggplot(df[df[&quot;country&quot;] == &quot;United States&quot;,], aes(x=year, y=co2)) + geom_line(color=&quot;darkred&quot;, size=1) + ggtitle(&quot;US CO2 Emissions 1965-2018&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;CO2 Emissions (millions of tonnes)&quot;) Intuitively, the increase in emissions correlates with the growth of the United States. As population and industry increases, emissions end up increasing due to the increased power demand of the country. However, if we look at the amount of CO2 generated for each unit of power produced for the US, a different image appears. ggplot(df[df[&quot;country&quot;] == &quot;United States&quot;,], aes(x=year, y=emission_ratio)) + geom_line(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, size=1) + ggtitle(&quot;US CO2 Emissions Ratio 1965-2018&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;CO2 Emissions Ratio (millions of tonnes/TWh)&quot;) This plot shows that the United States’ emissions ratio (millions of tonnes of CO2 emitted per each TWh generated) has been decreasing throughout time. This decrease implies that the US is becoming more CO2 efficient when generating power and can be due to a variety of factors, such as switching to more renewable energy sources and increaseing the efficiency of both renewable and non-renewable energy generation. We can see the relationship between the decreasing emission ratio and switching to renewable energy sources by plotting the US’s renewable ratio, which is the percent of energy consumed that was generated from renewable sources. ggplot(df[df[&quot;country&quot;] == &quot;United States&quot;,], aes(x=year, y=renew_ratio)) + geom_line(color=&quot;darkblue&quot;, size=1) + ggtitle(&quot;US Renewable Ratio 1965-2018&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Renewable Ratio (TWh/TWh)&quot;) The sharp increase in the US’s renewable energy usage around 2010 seems to match with the sharper decrease in the emissions ratio. These plots show that while the US is still emitting large amounts of CO2, they are making changes to reduce the amount of CO2 released during power generation. Interestingly, this relationship between the renewable ratio and emissions ratio appears not just in the US, but across the globe. The plot below plots each country’s yearly emissions ratio versus their renewable ratio. There is a noticeable downward trend in the plot, suggesting that as a country’s renewable ratio increases (meaning they switch to more renewable energy sources), their emissions ratio decreases (meaning they release less CO2 per unit power generated). ggplot(df, aes(x=renew_ratio, y=emission_ratio)) + geom_point(color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;, size=1) + ggtitle(&quot;Yearly Emissions Ratio vs Renewable Ratio&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Renewable Ratio (TWh/TWh)&quot;, y = &quot;Emissions Ratio (millions of tonnnes CO2 / TWh)&quot;) Additionally the large number of points on the left side of the plot is likely the result of countrys’ having a low renewable ratio. These countries with low renewable ratios likely won’t see a impact on their emissions as a result of renewables because of the low amount of renewable energy. As a result, there isn’t a relationship between renewables and emissions when renewables is close to zero, so the emissions ratios for these low renewable energy countries varies widely. However, when moving toward higher renewable ratios, the downward trends begins appearing. "],
